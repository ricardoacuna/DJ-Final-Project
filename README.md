# DJ-Final-Project
This repository contains the final Jupyter Notebook of the DJ final project and the datasets and archives necessary to run it. 
1. One of the datasets ('Establishments_df') cannot be uploaded because it is too big. Download from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TckBWACH7yXf0KYV7h3F_5jzfr2unkM8/view?usp=sharing. 
The rest of them are in the Datasets folder in the repository. 
2. Please download all the files before running the notebook. Having the CSV files is necessary to get the merged tables with all the variables. Although when running the notebook another csv files are created make sure these are downloaded too. Everytime I run the code, the CSV files are replaced by new ones and the changes made (eg. renaming columns) were deleted. That is why I changed the name of the archives so they won't be replaced.
